## The worldwide SPEAKABLE project

Have you ever tried to imagine if it is possible for machine to **learn the basic speaking rules, in natural way**?
Spontaneous phrases composing as a reply for some need, some question, situation...
Maybe it is possible to be inspired by infants' struggling with comprehension and mastering speaking skills?

We have technology - **Recurrent Neural Networks** and its extension: **Long Short-Term Memory** networks. It is fairly easy to crate a simple **text generator** which can learn from some examples (texts), learn spatial and squential rules and finally compose its own words, its own phrases and sentences.

On the net we have several examples - feeding the algorithm with some book and having fun seeing the results - a machine "speaking" in Edgar Allan Poe's or Lewis Carroll's style...

### What if we could supply our algorithm with natural sentences, with all the daily fuss present on our homes? With the environment which every child is being emerged in and which the child learns from ...

I'd like to split this project in 2 parts:
### 1. Machine Learning Algorithm
It will be a standard **Python/TensorFlow/Theano/Keras** stack. We will start with some reasonable Natural Language Processing implementation and try to adjust it for aur specific needs. The first change would be changing single letter resolution approach to single **syllable** or single **sound** approach. This is essential in therms of natural learning based on hearing, not reading.

I could imagine extension to this approach - learning from sounds directly, but for now, for the sake of the prove-of-concept, let's stay with the **text-like** concept.

### 2. The Home Fuss Repository
This is the best part!
I'm going to inspire all of you to push the scripts. From single phrases to long conversations. In all possible languages. This would be the heart of the **Speakable** project.
Having lots of language samples we could experiment and find out which communication elements would pop up first, how the learning process takes place. We finally could assess if it is similar to the way our kids learn to speak.


Every speaking success of our Artificial Infant will be published to SHOW OFF!!! We will celebrate every breakthrough! Like real devoted parents ;-)

Thanks for participating and have fun !!!
